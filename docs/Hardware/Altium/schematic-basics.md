After [setting up your project](../../Hardware/Altium/project-setup.md), you can begin designing the schematic. This acts as a blueprint of the circuit. Once it's created and validated, Altium can use it to populate and update the PCB with components.

## Adding Symbols

1. Choose a part from the components panel
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
        <img src="/../../Hardware/Altium/Images/components-panel.png" alt="Components Panel"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
    </div>

2. Right-click on the part and select **Place**. If the component has multiple parts, you will have to place each part individually. The component will cycle through parts A → ? and then go back to A again.

3. The symbol will appear translucent. Position it by hovering the mouse over the desired position and click to place. Right-click or ++esc++ to cancel. After placing the symbol, rotate it by selecting it and pressing ++space++.

    <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
        <img src="/../../Hardware/Altium/Images/placing-component.png" alt="Placing Component"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
    </div>

4. Once placed, you can select the symbol and go to the **Properties** panel to access details.

## Annotating the Schematic

A component is labeled using a designator which can be edited in the **Properties** tab. The prefix (letter) is based on the type of part, and the number distinguishes it from other components of the same type.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
    <img src="/../../Hardware/Altium/Images/set-designator.png" alt="Setting Designator"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

These are some common components:

- R - Resistor 
- C - Capacitor
- L - Inductor
- K - Relay
- Q - Transistor
- TP - Test Point
- U - Integrated Circuit

<br>

To automatically annotate components:

1. To to **Tools → Annotate Schematics Quietly**.
2. To undo or redo the annotation, you can go to **Tools → Annotate Schematics** which allows more fine-tuned control.

Alternatively, components can be manually batch-annotated by type:

1. Right-click on any one placed component (e.g., a resistor).
2. Select **Find Similar Objects**.
3. In the window, set **Designator** and **Kind** as **Same**.
4. Click **OK** — this selects all similar parts (e.g., all resistors).
5. Go to **Tools → Annotate Schematics Quietly**.

## Connecting Parts

Components in a schematic are connected together with a net. This can be indicated either by physically wiring them together or assigning a net label. 

### Wire

A wire can be drawn by right-click and select **Place → Wire**, or more easily, with ++ctrl+w++.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
    <img src="/../../Hardware/Altium/Images/select-wire.png" alt="Selecting Wire"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

Hover to position and click at the connecting pin to attach. Then click on the other component where it should connect. The wire adjusts when the component is moved.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
    <img src="/../../Hardware/Altium/Images/connecting-wire.png" alt="Connecting Wire"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

### Net

All connected components are part of the same net. In a schematic, you can indicate that a component is part of a particular net, even if it appears separate, by placing a net label.

Connect a short bit of wire to the desired pin. Then, similar to placing the wire, right-click and select **Place → Net Label**. This should be connected to the end of the wire, and the text edited to indicate which net it is a part of.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
    <img src="/../../Hardware/Altium/Images/net-label.png" alt="Net Label"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

### Port

A port makes a connection between multiple sheets of a schematic. The name of the port on one sheet corresponds to the name of the port on the other sheet to which it connects. It is placed the same way as a wire or net label. It is standard to only use net labels for local connections and ports for global connections across sheets.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
    <img src="/../../Hardware/Altium/Images/port-label-1.png" alt="Port Label on Sheet 1"  style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
    <img src="/../../Hardware/Altium/Images/port-label-2.png" alt="Port Label on Sheet 2"  style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

A power port specifically indicates a connection to a power or ground net.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
    <img src="/../../Hardware/Altium/Images/power-port-label.png" alt="Power Port Label"  style="max-width: 48%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

### Schematic Templates

[Schematic templates](../../Hardware/Altium/schematic-templates.md) are used to format information about your schematic. The RIT Racing library has a standardized template that should be used for all designs.

## Validation

Once the schematic is complete, it needs to be validated to check for any errors. Validation must be completed before generating the PCB layout.

To do this, go to **Project → Validate Project**.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
    <img src="/../../Hardware/Altium/Images/validate-project.png" alt="Validate Project"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

Errors or warnings in the schematic design will appear in the **Messages** panel. Some can be ignored, but others indicate issues that need to be resolved. Go through the errors carefully continuing to the PCB Design stage. In this example, a wire has been removed to demonstrate the resulting errors that must be corrected:

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
    <img src="/../../Hardware/Altium/Images/validate-project-warnings.png" alt="Validate Project Warnings"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</div>
